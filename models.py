            The Research & Training Departments is divided into three sub-departments:
            Data Analysis
            Machine Learning
            Deep Learning


            Our Idea for the competition that we are in, called Leaders League, is the HACKATHON'25. 
            We plan this event to take place in early February 2025 and get a target of 3K t0 3.5K attendees. 
            HACKATHON'25 is a three day event that consists of three crucial components:
            Competition or the Hackathon itself: will happen during day 1, day 2, and day 3
            AI Fair: During day 3
            AI Stage: During day 3

            Competition:
            The Hackathon is a technical competition that will allow competitors to innovate solutions and bring them to life for a problem in a certain industry.
            Because we value inclusivity and we want to make everyone be involved, we have decided not to do one very advanced competition for only the advanced people.
            the Compeition or Hackathon will consists of three Competitions happening parallely at the same time.
            The first Competition (Beginners) will make competitors use Data Analysis to inovate a solution for a problem in the climate change, helping in contributing to the 13th SDG climate action.
            The second Competition (Intermediate) will make competitors use Machine Learning technique to create a solution for a problem in the economical and financial industry specifically fintech, helping in contributing to the 8th SDG Good Jobs & Economic Growth.
            The third Competition (Professional) will make competitors use Deep Learning techniques to innovate and improve the educational system specifically E-Learning, helping in contributing to the 4th SDG Quality Education.
            We are aiming to get 120 to 150 attendees for every competition and divided to teams of 3-4 members. Our main goal for this component is to get atleast 1 team to represent every university in egypt that offers Ai & Data Science.
            
            Ai Fair:
            The Ai Fair is going To provide a venue for companies, startups, and educational institutions to present their AI-related products, services, and research.
            The fair is going to be divided into 3 compartments:
            Startups Compartment: Startups are crucial for the development of the industry and that is why their presence is a win-win situation for both the student and the employers.
            Mid-Large Companies: We know that their cant be a successful fair without the big companies stepping in, that is why we have already contacted with multiple companies and they have shown interest. However will only offer Ai vacancies.
            Communities: We haven't forgotten that we are a a student community, that is why we have decided to help other student communities that are also focused on Ai to be known from other students and employers.

            A huge event filled with opprotunities to grow, connect and learn, three important values for us.
